# Hospital Management System

Welcome to the Hospital Management System repository! This web application is built using Django for the backend, HTML for markup, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic interactions. The system provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) features and integrates with a database to manage hospital-related data. Users can view and interact with data through user-friendly tables.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Perform basic CRUD operations on hospital-related data, including patients, doctors, and appointments.

- **Database Integration with Django ORM**: The system uses Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to interact with the database, making it easy to manage and retrieve data.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The web app features an intuitive and responsive interface for efficient data management.

- **Data Visualization with Tables**: View data in organized tables for easy comprehension and analysis.
